LiveSplit.MagneticByNature
=====================

LiveSplit.MagneticByNature is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) script for Magnetic By Nature.

Features
--------
  * Keeps track of Game Time to get rid of loading times.
  * Auto start/stop/reset the timer.
  * Splits when you finish each split in Any%. [Here](http://www.speedrun.com/Magnetic_by_Nature/resources) are some easy split files.
  * Does not currently work for categories that involve World 5. If someone wants to give me the name of the last level of World 5 I can make it work. But I'm bad at the game, so I haven't gotten that far and don't know the name of the last level.

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.MagneticByNature automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "Magnetic By Nature" and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.MagneticByNature to the Components folder.

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and active the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Game Time.

#### Auto Split
The default settings are to automatically reset, start, and split.

#### Alternate Timing Method
If you wish to show Real Time on your layout, download AlternateTimingMethod from the [LiveSplit Components page](http://livesplit.org/components/) or its own [Github page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
