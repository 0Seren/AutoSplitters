LiveSplit.UndeadRiderAsylum
=====================

LiveSplit.UndeadRiderAsylum is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) script for Undead Rider Asylum.

Features
--------
  * Removes End Score Screens to calculate IGT to make times more fair across machines and runs.
  * Auto reset/start the timer when gaining control in the first level. This includes resetting while on the first level.
  * Splits when changing levels and at the end of the last level.

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.UndeadRiderAsylum automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "Undead Rider Asylum" for the game (it should autocomplete the game name) and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.UndeadRiderAsylum to the Components folder.

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and active the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Game Time.

#### Alternate Timing Method
If you wish to show Real Time on your layout, download AlternateTimingMethod from the [LiveSplit Components page](http://livesplit.org/components/) or its own [Github page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
