LiveSplit.Woolfe
=====================

LiveSplit.Woolfe is a [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) script for Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries.

Features
--------
  * Keeps track of Game Time to get rid of loading times.

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.Woolfe automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries" and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.Woolfe to the Components folder.

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and active the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Game Time.

#### Alternate Timing Method
If you wish to show Real Time on your layout, download AlternateTimingMethod from the [LiveSplit Components page](https://livesplit.org/components/) or its own [Github page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
