AutoSplitters for [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/)
=====================
[How AutoSplitters Work](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit/blob/master/Documentation/Auto-Splitters.md)

Features (See individual folders for more details)
--------
  * Can keep track of Game Time to get rid of loading times.
  * Can automatically start/stop/reset the timer.
  * Can automatically split

Install
-------
![Activate AutoSplitter](/Resources/activate autosplitter.png?raw=true "Activate AutoSplitter")

Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install all autosplitters automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in the game name, and click Activate. This downloads the AutoSplitter to the Components folder.

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and active the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

![Compare to Game Time](/Resources/compare to game time.png?raw=true "Compare to Game Time")

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Game Time.

#### Auto Split
The default settings are to automatically reset, start, and split.

#### Alternate Timing Method
If you wish to show Real Time on your layout, download AlternateTimingMethod from the [LiveSplit Components page](http://livesplit.org/components/) or its own [Github page](https://github.com/Dalet/LiveSplit.AlternateTimingMethod/releases).
